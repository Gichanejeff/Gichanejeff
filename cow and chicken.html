<br>
<p1>Cow and Chicken are going on a field trip to Folsom Prison. 
    He reluctantly is sitting next to her because Mom and Dad told him to do so. 
    Cow annoys Chicken so he sits back with Flem and Earl through the rest of the ride. </p1>
<br>
<p2>Once inside the prison, they get into the main yard when Chicken puts on Red's prison
     suit and befriends the other prisoners. However, a guard offends him by hitting him 
     with his stick. In retaliation, Chicken pulls his pants down slyly and called jailbreak. 
     The guard shouts to sound the alarm and falls down after tripping on his own pants. 
     The prisoners are laughing and congratulates Chicken, thinking he's Redd. The guard is 
     offended and screams, "Lock-down!" As Chicken is being sent away, the real Redd assumes 
     Chicken's name by taking his name-tag, and escapes on the school bus. This leads to Chicken 
     attempting to start a riot and being sent to the warden's office for discipline.</p2>
<br>
  <p3>Cow eventually suspects Red of being a fake because she knows Chicken would never play with her. 
    She assumes her Super Cow form and uses her tricycle to take the diapered Redd back to prison. 
    She rescues Chicken and takes him home, while leaving Red (Who is still diapered) in jail with the 
    other prisoners. Redd asks the prisoners if they wanna play jump rope, to which they accept.</p3>    
 <br>
 <p4>Later on at home, Dad informs him about the warden from Folsom Prison calling. Chicken confessed
     that he knew why the warden called, that he did time in Folsom Prison for pantsing the guard.
      Dad tells him that it was because left his name tag there, but he then appreciates Chicken being
       honest with him. Mom then announces that she and Dad are serving both Cow and Chicken their 
       favorite dinner: Pork Butts and 'Taters. Both run to the other side of the dining room as the 
       food is then launched via catapult, The parents are laughing happily as Cow and Chicken jump about, 
       hungrily snagging the Pork Butts and 'Taters in mid-air with their teeth.
<br>
    As a Pork Butt smashes through a living room window and bounces away out onto the street, the viewer hears this:</p4>
