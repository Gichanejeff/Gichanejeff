<h1>My Best Friend Story</h1>
<img src="best friend.png" alt="my friend">
<br>
<p1>Five months after moving to a new home with her husband 
    and then two-year-old daughter, Judith gave birth to a beautiful 
    girl with a severe case of clubfoot. Due to her daughters condition, 
    she has to go to numerous doctor appointments while taking care of 
    her elder daughter at the same time. Feeling tired all the time, 
    Judith had difficulty maintaining the household chores. </p1>
<br>
<p2>One day after coming from a doctors visit, Judith was surprised to
     see the front door ajar. She cautiously entered her home only to find
      that the floor was spotless, the dishes were all washed and dried, 
      and the dirty laundry was washed and folded. There were even flowers 
      beside her bed when she went upstairs!</p2>
<br>
  <p3>It turned out that the person who cleaned her house was her friend Joy. 
    While driving by her home, Joy noticed that Judiths car was gone so she 
    took that opportunity to help her friend.</p3>
