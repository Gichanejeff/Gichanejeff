<br>
<p1>Dexter's Laboratory stars the young Dexter, a diminutive genius whose 
    passion for science has led him to create an enormous secret laboratory 
    under his typical suburban home. There, he creates and experiments with 
    robots, shrink rays, and bionic appendages under the adoring eye of his 
    central computer. Or rather, that's what he would do if his older, 
    carefree sister Dee Dee wasn't always interfering by dancing, jumping 
    around, and just being a girl (eww!), destroying everything in sight and 
    ruining all of his experiments. </p1>
<br>
<p2>Created by Genndy Tartakovsky, Dexter's Laboratory shares the same
    production team of CalArts alumni behind 2 Stupid Dogs and The Powerpuff
    Girls; as such, expect the same kind of graphic design, riffs on pop
    culture, and homages to anim√©, comics, and science fiction. Dexter's 
    Laboratory also features the "Dial M for Monkey" and "Justice Friends" 
    as series-within-a-series. "Dial M for Money" focuses on the adventures 
    of Dexter's lab monkey, who is secretly a super-powered agent for a 
    government organization; the Justice Friends are a parody of Marvel 
    Comics' Avengers, complete with all-American hero Major Glory.</p2>
<br>
  <p3>As of March 30, 2012, the series has returned to Cartoon Network in
    re-runs on the revived block, Cartoon Planet. The series originally 
    aired on YTV in Canada. On May 5, 2012, Dexter's Laboratory moved to 
    Teletoon, airing Saturdays at 12:30PM ET, in favor of the launch of 
    Cartoon Network.</p3>
