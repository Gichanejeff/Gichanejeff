<h2>Do you enjoy reading stories?</h2>
<p1>Reading short stories in English is 
a great way to improve your language level. 
In this section, read our short stories that were specially written 
for English language learners. There are two sections, one for lower 
level learners (A2/B1) and one for higher levels (B2/C1). You will improve 
your reading fluency and comprehension and develop your vocabulary. Each 
story has interactive exercises to help you understand and use the language. </p1>
